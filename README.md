# Intro
Hi! 
My name is Jorge, i'm a Software Developer entering the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence field, with an intense interest in Generative AI and its transformative power. 
My last employement was at Bosch, where i worked for a brief period as a Senior Software Developer allocated to a Master Data Management|Finance project, collaborating internationally and getting my feet wet again after a sabbatical period during which i kept studying to avoid knowledge drift, while conciling that with being a parent.

After Bosch, i decided to learn new things.

Every major shift in paradigm, like the one we're currently witnessing in its early stages, fills the market with opportunities. There's a new industry but not enough marketable products taking advantage of that. 
Capturing the essence of those shifts, developing groundbreaking concepts and highly innovative tools to give squads in the Creative & Entertainment Industry the ability to create competitive edges that are just, mwah! 

I bring an ample and multidisciplinary toolkit. My career demonstratesd the ease with which i adopted emerging trends even before they became trends; i bring that to the table as well.
I am bringing the knowledge i absorbed from my career MDM and blending it with my previous role, Full Stack Developer, which i performed for almost my entire career until i decided to dive head first into this; it had always been my objective, and now the time is just right.

I witnessed a LOT of those shifts: from computers that took forever to turn on, to the advent of the Internet (this was when i started learning programming, around 1996), weeping incessantly due to websites that were just a table (who thought that was a good idea??), then i got employed because of Flash (Action Script was the first language that i actually learned and loved); AJAX, Tableless... that's when things started to shake rapidly. Tools, platforms, languages, frameworks, bubbling up all the time... does any of that sound familiar? ;)
