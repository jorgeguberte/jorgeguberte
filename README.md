# Intro
Hi! 
My name is Jorge, i'm a Software Developer entering the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence field, with an intense interest in Generative AI and its transformative power. 
My last employement was at Bosch, where i worked for a brief period as a Senior Software Developer allocated to a Master Data Management/Finance project, collaborating internationally and getting my feet wet again after a sabbatical period during which i kept studying to avoid knowledge drift, while conciling that with being a parent.

To formalize my education, i enrolled in College and i'm currently majoring in System Analysis and Development.
Outside of the Academic realm, I am currently focused on studying Generative AI, Machine Learning, DevOps and MLOps, and also getting some Azure certifications.
