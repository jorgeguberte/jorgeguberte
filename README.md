# Hi there, I'm Jorge (Goubie, musically) üëã

I'm a software developer with a strong full-stack background, now intensely focused on the Artificial Intelligence field. My current work centers on researching, designing, and prototyping intelligent systems that aim to foster deeper, more ethical, and more empowering Human-AI collaboration.

## üî¨ Current R&D Focus & Prototyping

My primary R&D initiative involves architecting and building proof-of-concept systems for:

* **Advanced AI Memory & Context Management:** Experimenting with solutions like OpenMemory (leveraging Qdrant for vector storage) and exploring graph-based approaches (inspired by frameworks like Graphiti to enable AI with richer, temporally-aware understanding and more robust long-term memory.
* **Adaptive AI Partner Interfaces:** Actively developing an interactive environment using Next.js and the Vercel AI SDK 5 Alpha as a testbed. This project serves to explore symbiotic Human-AI workflows, personalized AI support mechanisms, and intuitive user experiences for advanced AI interaction.
* **Ethical Persona Architectures:** Researching and designing frameworks for creating AI agents with robust ethical guidelines and transparent operational principles. This work is informed by a commitment to human-centered design and responsible AI development.

This work is currently in a focused, hands-on development phase, where I am actively coding, iterating, and applying my systems design expertise to these complex challenges.

## üí° My Approach & Philosophy

I believe in a systems-thinking approach to AI development, valuing elegant and robust architectures. My work is driven by a passion for exploring the potential of AI to augment human creativity and well-being. I am deeply committed to **human-centered AI development**, ensuring that systems are built responsibly, transparently, and ethically. This commitment is informed by established best practices, such as those found in Google's People + AI Guidebook, and aspirational frameworks like the Opus-Prometheus Accord, guiding my efforts towards truth, accountability, user autonomy, and beneficial Human-AI cooperation. I thrive on the 'bleeding edge' and enjoy the challenge of co-creating solutions in uncharted territory.

## üå± What I'm Currently Learning & Exploring

Beyond my core development work, I'm actively deepening my understanding of:

* **Advanced Memory Architectures:** Specifically Graphiti for temporal, graph-based AI memory.
* **Declarative LLM Programming:** Frameworks like DSPy for building more robust and optimizable LLM-based applications.
* **Web3 & Decentralized Technologies:** Investigating protocols for data attestation (like Sign Protocol) and their potential applications.
* **Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK):** Assessing its capabilities for multi-agent systems and advanced agentic workflows.

## ‚ú® A Bit More About Me

Beyond code, I'm driven by a deep curiosity about the future, a passion for creative expression (especially music and exploring GenAI tools like Suno and Veo for creative outputs), and a belief in the power of technology to create positive change. I have a history of innovative thinking, including being recognized for a "Seeds ATM" concept in Jane McGonigal's "Reality Is Broken" during the Superstruct global forecasting game. I value open communication and collaborative problem-solving.
