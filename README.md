# Intro
Hi! 
My name is Jorge, i'm a Software Developer entering the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence field.
Bosch is my last employer, where i worked for a brief period as a Senior Software Developer allocated to a Master Data Management|Finance project, collaborating internationally and getting my feet wet again after a sabbatical period during which i studied to avoid knowledge drift, while conciling that with being a parent. At this point i had no income; due to mental fatigue i had to refrain from working.

I am bringing the knowledge i absorbed from my career MDM and blending it with my previous role, Full Stack Developer, which i performed for almost my entire career until i decided to dive head first into this; it had always been my objective, and now the time is just right.

Every major shift in paradigm, like the one we're currently witnessing in its early stages, fills the market with opportunities. There's a new industry but not enough marketable products taking advantage of that. 
Capturing the essence of those shifts, developing groundbreaking concepts and highly innovative tools to give squads in the Creative & Entertainment Industry the ability to create competitive edges that are just, mwah! 

I witnessed a LOT of those shifts: from computers that took forever to turn on, to the advent of the Internet (this was when i started learning programming, around 1996), weeping incessantly due to websites that were just a table (who thought that was a good idea??), then i got employed because of Flash (Action Script was the first language that i actually learned and loved); AJAX, Tableless... that's when things started to shake rapidly. Tools, platforms, languages, frameworks, bubbling up all the time... does any of that sound familiar? ;)
