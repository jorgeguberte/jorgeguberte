### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Right, so i decided to settle on Vue as my framework of choice. I adapted well to it, did some digging and it fits all my needs. There's still some kinks to iron out, like commiting to Vue 3 or deciding to hold on and stick to Vue 2 for now until Vue 3 is more mature, but that's secondary.
With my stack of choice finally evened out, i can start working again, after having to take a long break for health purposes.
