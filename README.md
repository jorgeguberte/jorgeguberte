# Intro
Hi! 
My name is Jorge, i'm a Software Developer entering the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence field.
My last employment was at Bosch, where i worked for a brief period in the Master Data Management domain.
I am bringing the knowledge i absorbed from MDM and blending it with my previous role, Full Stack Developer, which i performed for almost my entire career until i decided to dive head first into this; it had always been my objective, and now the time is just right.
