## About Me
Hi! 
I'm a Full Stack Engineer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, specialized in Javascript and Python stacks; lately i've been focusing on applying AI and ML techniques to develop innovative and meaningful experiences for users. 
Meanwhile, i'm pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Architecture and Urbanism, which are nice skills to have in my toolkit.
