## About Me
Hi! 
I'm a Full Stack Dev based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, specialized in Javascript and Python stacks; lately i've been focusing on applying AI and ML techniques to develop innovative and meaningful experiences for users. 
I've been working in the industry since 2006 in various capacitie, and in my last meaningful position I worked in the Master Data Management domain, collaborating with end-to-end solutions for a company-wide migration to modern data engineering systems.
