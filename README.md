Hi!
I architect and build systems for memory & context management, generative interfaces, and agentic orchestration for long-term coherence.

I also develop language models for low-resource language preservation [(Ayvu)](https://github.com/jorgeguberte/ayvu-talian-base), and a high-performance embeddable graph database.

Co-Founder & CTO at Hub Esfera, a B2G data intelligence startup, leading development for our flagship product.
