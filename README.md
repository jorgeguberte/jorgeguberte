## About Me
Hiya! 
I like to build rapid-prototypes, originally a backend-heavy full-stack guy, generalist, musician, bedroom producer, currently exploring sonic and visual frontiers with Generative AI.

I'm training custom models to serve as effective creative partners, crafting songs together, reaching a symbiotic partnership; model grounding and fine-tuning are becoming strong suits for me. Eloquent enough to produce substantial results via prompting.


Available for hire. JS|TypeScript|Python.
