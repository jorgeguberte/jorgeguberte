## Currently working on:
I'm working on a personal project named Scoutive, with a friend. Scoutive is an open-source platform that helps soccer scouts have a better, more streamlined experience and performance in their job. It connects soccer scouts, agents and clubs, and make it easier to reach players who would otherwise be harder to reach.
